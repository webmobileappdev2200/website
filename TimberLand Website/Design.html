                <font color="#fff" size="5">The main goal of the Tree Lab is to deliver a unique experience to anyone who walks through the door, while presenting products in a creative and modern fashion. During their visit, shoppers can take their time and test out some product
                    while enjoying a local craft beer from Troegs Independent Brewing, or enjoy a bottle of water that may one day be recycled into Timberland® shoe linings or laces.
                    <p>

                        “The Tree Lab is more than just a place to shop -- everything a consumer experiences from the moment they enter has been designed to enhance their visit, expand their horizons, and leave them with a great memory to go along with that beautiful new pair
                        of shoes.” - Kate Kibler, VP of Timberland’s direct to consumer business in North America
                        <p>

                            Be on the lookout for the first store transformation, where we’ll be switching from Streetology to Shevolution in late September. The new installation will focus entirely on women, with a curated selection of boots and shoes that are feminine, tough,
                            beautiful, and of course, well-crafted.</font>
